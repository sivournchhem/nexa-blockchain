# **Nexa Core Whitepaper**
## **1. Abstract**
Nexa Core is a decentralized blockchain protocol combining **Hybrid Proof-of-Work (PoW) and Proof-of-Stake (PoS)** for enhanced **security and efficiency**.

## **2. Vision & Mission**
- **Vision:** To be the most **secure, scalable, and decentralized blockchain**.
- **Mission:** Provide **high-speed transactions, smart contract functionality, and community-driven governance**.

## **3. Technical Overview**
### **3.1 Hybrid PoW + PoS**
- PoW ensures security, PoS enhances energy efficiency.
- Blocks are validated by both miners and stakers.
- Prevents 51% attacks and ensures fair distribution.

### **3.2 WASM Smart Contracts**
- Supports WebAssembly for decentralized applications.
- High execution speed with low computational cost.

### **3.3 Fixed Supply: 23M NXA**
- **No additional minting** beyond 23M NXA.
- **80% distributed to the community** (miners/stakers).
- **20% allocated to the founder**.

## **4. Governance & Decentralization**
- **Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO).**
- **On-chain voting system** allows community decision-making.
- **Immutable governance rules** secured by blockchain.

## **5. Security Measures**
- **Peer authentication & advanced encryption.**
- **Double-spend protection** and network security.
- **Regular audits to enhance system integrity.**

## **6. Scalability & Future Enhancements**
- **Sharding & ZK-Rollups** for infinite scalability.
- **Optimized transaction processing.**
- **Integration with major blockchain ecosystems.**

## **7. Conclusion**
Nexa Core is designed to be the **most advanced decentralized blockchain**, offering **speed, security, and efficiency for global adoption**.
